# Publications

Hello there!

This is a space reserved to the publications I am part of, for the time time being I do not have access to post
the preprint papers on arxiv so my idea was to simplyput them available in this repo.

Feel free to open an issue with fixes, requests o anything related to the content in here.

- [Jornada Investigadora 2025 - A maturity model for Test-Driven Development adoption in professional settings
](./paper-tdd-maturity-model-jornadas-investigadoras-2025.pdf)
- [Computers 2024 - Exploring the Connection between the TDD Practice and Test Smells—A Systematic Literature Review](./exploring-the-connection-between-the-tdd-practice-and-test-smells-a-systematic-literature-review.pdf)
